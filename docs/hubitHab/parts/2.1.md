2.1 When you contact us, for example through our contact form or via email, we collect personal data. The specific data collected through our contact form can be viewed directly on the form within the app. This data is stored and used solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry, contacting you, and associated technical administration. The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request, as outlined in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If your contact is intended to conclude a contract, an additional legal basis for processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Your data will be deleted once your request has been processed. This occurs when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the matter has been fully resolved, provided there are no conflicting legal obligations to retain the data.
